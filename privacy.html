                    under the age of 16 has provided us with personal information, we will endeavor to purge any such
                    information as soon as possible. <br> <br>

                    Visitors to our SITE and services will have multiple manners of interacting with us. Depending upon
                    your level of interaction, we will collect different information about you. We collect information
                    about you directly from you and from third parties, as well as automatically through your use of our
                    SITE. The type of information collected is as follows: <br> <br>

                    Account Registration. When you register for an Account, we may ask for your contact information,
                    including items such as name, company name, address, email address, and telephone number. If you
                    choose to refer a friend to our Services, we may also collect your friend’s email address so that we
                    may send them a referral or promotional code to sign up for our Services. <br> <br>

                    Payment Information. When you add your financial account information to your Account, that
                    information is directed to our third-party payment processor. We do not store your financial account
                    information on our systems; however, we have access to, and may retain, subscriber information
                    through our third-party payment processor. <br> <br>

                    Personal Data. This means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable
                    of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a user in
                    particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an
                    online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic,
                    mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person. “Personal Data” includes
                    equivalent terms in other Data Protection Law, such as the CCPA- defined term “Personal
                    Information,” as context requires. <br> <br>

                    User Content. Our “Community” feature allows you to publicly post content on our Services. By
                    registering for our Community, you agree that your profile information and the content you post may
                    be viewed and used by other users and third parties we do not control. <br> <br>

                    Communications. If you contact us directly, we may receive additional information about you such as
                    your name, email address, phone number, the contents of the message and/or attachments you may send
                    us, and any other information you may choose to provide. We may also receive a confirmation when you
                    open an email from us. The personal information that you are asked to provide, and the reasons why
                    you are asked to provide it, will be made clear to you at the point we ask you to provide your
                    personal information. <br> <br>

                    Additionally, we define all visitors on our SITE in the following formats: <br> <br>

                    Members - Members are those users who subscribe to our services will be prompted to provide their
                    name, their address, their age, their phone number, and any other necessary billing information.
                    <br> <br>

                    Posters - Posters are visitors to our SITE who choose to register to post information in our public
                    forums. We collect your email address and the password you create for your account when you
                    register, and we also collect information about your posts to our forums. Any information entered
                    voluntarily by the Poster on one of our forums should be considered public information or
                    information that is publicly available. If you do not wish for information to be made public, you
                    should not enter it into your user profile when registering as a Poster. <br> <br>

                    All SITE users and visitors - We automatically collect the following information from all users and
                    visitors to our SITE through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies: your domain name; your
                    browser type and operating system; web pages you view; links you click; your IP address; the length
                    of time you visit or use our SITE; and the referring URL, or the webpage that led you to our SITE.
                    We may combine this information with other information that we have collected about you, including,
                    where applicable, your user name, name, and other personal information. Please see the section
                    “Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms” below for more information.

                    We and our third party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms, including those
                    designed for mobile applications, to track information about your use of our SITE. We may combine
                    this information with other personal information we collect from you (and our third party service
                    providers may do so on our behalf). <br> <br>

                    Cookies. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your device’s hard drive through
                    your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to
                    navigate our SITE, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track
                    your activities at our SITE and service, including for online advertising purposes. <br> <br>

                    Disabling Cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit
                    your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers
                    will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser
                    notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our SITE
                    who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the SITE, but some features may not
                    function. <br> <br>

                    Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique
                    identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your
                    device’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a.
                    web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our SITE to, among other things, track the
                    activities of SITE visitors and users, help us manage content, and compile statistics about SITE
                    usage. We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers,
                    to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our
                    emails are forwarded. <br> <br>

                    Third Party Analytics. We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to
                    evaluate usage of our SITE. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our SITE. We use these
                    tools to help us improve our services, performance, and user experiences. These entities may use
                    cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. To learn more about Google’s
                    privacy practices, please review the Google Policy at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/. You
                    can also download the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on to prevent their data from being used
                    by Google Analytics at https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout. <br> <br>

                    Do-Not-Track. Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may,
                    however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies); you
                    also may opt-out of targeted advertising by following the instructions in the Third Party Ad Network
                    section. <br> <br>

                    Third-Party Ad Networks. We use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on
                    third-party websites or other media (e.g., social networking platforms). This enables us and these
                    third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be
                    interested. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement
                    services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other
                    tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising
                    content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s
                    specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with
                    information, including personal information, about you. <br> <br>

                    Users in the United States may opt out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to
                    the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Consumer Choice Page for information about opting out of
                    interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by DAA companies. You
                    may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) Consumer Opt-Out Page for information
                    about opting out of interest- based advertising and their choices regarding having information used
                    by NAI members. <br> <br>

                    Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA Consumer Choice Page or the NAI Consumer
                    Opt-Out Page will opt you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to
                    you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our SITE or on other
                    websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website
                    that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject
                    cookies when you opt out on the DAA or NAI websites, yours opt out may not be effective. Additional
                    information is available on the DAA’s website at www.aboutads.info or the NAI’s website at
                    www.networkadvertising.org.
