                        (a) These Terms. LxRoot can change, update, add or remove provisions of these Terms at any time
                        by posting the updated Terms on the Site and by providing a notice on the Services. We will ask
                        for your express consent to the updated Terms where we are legally required to do so, and our
                        notice to you will explain how you can accept or reject the changes. If you do not agree with
                        any of the updated Terms, you must stop using the Services. Unless otherwise required by law,
                        the updated Terms are effective as of the day of posting.

                        (b) The Services. LxRoot may make changes to the Services at any time, without notice to you. If
                        you object to any changes to the Services, your sole recourse will be to cease using the
                        Services. Continued use of the Services following posting of any such changes will indicate your
                        acknowledgement of such changes and satisfaction with the Services as modified. We also reserve
                        the right to discontinue the Services, or any component of it, at any time without notice to
                        you. We will not be liable to you or any third party should we exercise our right to modify or
                        discontinue the Services.

                        (c) Paid subscriptions. Please note that if you are under paid-subscription services with us, in
                        the event we change the price for the services which you have previously agreed to pay or if we
                        substantially change the services you are paying for, we will also notify you of such changes as
                        contemplated in Section 3(a) above. Any changes will become effective after your then-current
                        subscription expires or terminates. If you do not agree with such changes and you communicate
                        this to us in accordance with the notification, we will not automatically renew your
                        subscription even if you previously agreed to automatic renewal for payment.

                        (d) Additional Terms. In addition, certain features of the Services may be subject to additional
                        terms of use (“Additional Terms”), which shall be provided to you at the moment you choose to
                        use such features or services. By using such features, or any part thereof, you agree to be
                        bound by the Additional Terms applicable to such features. In the event that any of the
                        Additional Terms governing such features conflict with these Terms, the Additional Terms will
                        govern.

                        (e) Executed Contract(s). If You have entered into a separate executed (i.e. signed) agreement
                        for services with LxRoot (collectively and individually, “Contract”), such Contract shall
                        supersede these Terms. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and the Contract, the
                        Contract will prevail. In cases where the Contract does not address specific provisions included
                        in these Terms, these Terms will apply, supplementing the Contract.

                        access to the Services without first becoming “Registered Users.”

                        (b) Registered Users and Accounts. In order to access certain features of the Services you will
                        be required to become a Registered User. A “Registered User” is a User who has registered an
                        account with us (your “Account”). As a Registered User you choose what information you may make
                        public or showcase. By registering as a User you represent that you are not barred from using
                        the Services under these Terms, the laws of the United States of America, your place of
                        residence or any other applicable jurisdiction.

                        (c) Registration Data. In registering for the Services, you agree to (i) provide true, accurate,
                        current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Services’ registration form
                        (the “Registration Data”); and (ii) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep
                        it true, accurate, current and complete. You agree that all notices and communications between
                        Us will be sent to the email address You provide. If you provide any information that is untrue,
                        inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or LxRoot has reasonable grounds to suspect that such
                        information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, LxRoot has the right to suspend or
                        terminate your Account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Services (or any
                        portion hereof) for breach. You agree not to create an Account using a false identity or
                        information. You agree that you shall not have more than one Account at any given time. You
                        agree not to register for an Account on behalf of an individual other than Yourself, or register
                        for an Account on behalf of any group or entity unless you are authorized to bind such person,
                        group, organization, or entity to these Terms. By registering another person, group,
                        organization, or entity you hereby represent that you are authorized to do so. You agree not to
                        create an Account or use the Services if you have been previously removed by LxRoot, or if you
                        have been previously banned from any of the LxRoot properties.

                        (d) Account Management. When You register for the Services, you will choose a login (email) and
                        password. You may use the Services or modify Your Content and data only through such login and
                        password. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Your password and
                        for any and all activities which occur using Your credentials and/or under your Account. LxRoot
                        reserves the right to establish an Account verification process to verify the account and/or any
                        information provided. You agree to immediately notify Us of any unauthorized use of Your Account
                        or any other breach of security known to (or reasonably suspected by) You at support@lxroot.com.
                        LxRoot shall be entitled to monitor your username and password and, at its discretion, require
                        you to change it. If you use a username and password that LxRoot considers insecure or
                        inappropriate, LxRoot will be entitled to require this to be changed and/or terminate your
                        Account. LxRoot reserves the right to remove or reclaim any usernames at any time and for any
                        reason, including but not limited to, claims by a third party that a username violates the third
                        party’s rights. It is also Your responsibility to make sure that Our domain(s) (including
                        “lxroot.com”) are not included in any spam block list used by You or Your mail provider. You are
                        required to perform all necessary security configuration and management tasks (1) for Your
                        site(s) and all domains, web pages or IP addresses which You are hosting through the Services,
                        and (2) to protect Your Content (defend below) and data, including that of Your customers and/or
                        end users hosted through the Services. You are responsible for management of updates and
                        security patches, any application software or utilities installed, any flees accessible via Your
                        site(s), and the configuration of any LxRoot-provided security utilities.

                        reserves the right to refuse to provide You with any Service for any reason. Notwithstanding Our
                        Uptime Guarantee, LxRoot also reserves the right to interrupt access to the Services to perform

                        provided that You agree to pay the then-current fees for such additional Services. All
                        additional services shall be considered "Services" hereunder. All Services provided are subject

                        For as long as you agree to these Terms and abide by them, you may use the Services. These Terms
                        apply to all Users of the Service, including Visitors and Registered Users, who are also
                        contributors of User Content. The Services are licensed, not sold, to you.

                        relevant LxRoot policies, LxRoot grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub

                        only. You agree not to use the Services for any other purpose.

                        Restrictions. You may not: (i) remove any copyright, trademark or other proprietary notices from

                        (a) Subscriptions. Your Subscription or commencement of the Services shall begin upon
                        confirmation to You and receipt of lawful funds, whichever comes earlier. The Subscription
                        initial term's length is chosen by You and shall be indicated when You subscribe to Our
                        Services. The Subscription may not be terminated by You during the Initial Term (and any
                        renewals thereof) except in the event of a breach by LxRoot. After the Initial Term, the
                        Subscription shall automatically renew for successive terms, equal in length to the Initial
                        Term, unless terminated or canceled by either party as provided herein.

                        (b) Pricing. Subject to Section 3(c), LxRoot reserves the right to change prices for paid
                        Subscriptions at any time and does not provide price protection or refunds in the event of
                        promotions or price decreases. Any pricing changes will become effective after your then-current
                        Subscription expires or terminates. You understand that if We agree to provide Services to You
                        in the future after your Subscription terminates for any reason, the amount You paid under any
                        prior term or time period is not determinative of the amount You will pay should We provide
                        Services to You again. It is Your responsibility to check Our Site for plan or price changes
                        should You wish to take advantage of plan or price changes which may have occurred. LxRoot does
                        not automatically update Your Subscription plan. All upgrades or downgrades will be performed at
                        Your request and may include modification Fees (defend in Section 7(a)) or require reinitiating
                        service with Us.

                        (c) Automatic Renewal Terms: To facilitate continuity of the Services to you, each paid
                        Subscription contains automatic renewal terms. LxRoot will automatically renew your paid
                        Subscription as per the Subscription period of your choosing (each a “Subscription Term”), on
                        the anniversary of that date that LxRoot first charges your Account for the first Subscription
                        fee, and, as authorized by you during the Subscription sign-up process, LxRoot will charge your
                        Account with the applicable Subscription fee and any sales or similar taxes that may be imposed
                        on your Subscription fee payment (unless you cancel prior to the anniversary date). Each
                        Subscription renewal period is for the same Subscription Term as the prior one, unless otherwise
                        agreed between you and LxRoot. IF YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE
                        SERVICES WILL BE SHUT OFF ONCE YOUR THEN CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION TERM EXPIRES.

                        LxRoot reserves the right to modify pricing at any time (but not the price in effect for your
                        then-current Subscription Term), upon advance notice to you. If you have not canceled your
                        Subscription or turned off the auto-renew function within the specified time after receiving
                        notice of a price change, your Subscription will auto-renew at the price indicated in your
                        notice.

                        (d) CANCELLATION TERMS: YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION AT ANY TIME, AND SUCH CANCELLATION
                        SHALL BECOME EFFECTIVE UPON EXPIRATION OF YOUR THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION TERM. You agree and
                        understand that you will be charged Subscription fees until the expiration of your then-current
                        Subscription Term and SUBSCRIPTION FEES WILL NOT BE REFUNDED, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, SUBJECT TO
                        APPLICABLE LAW. You will not be eligible for a pro-rated refund of any portion of the
                        Subscription fees paid for any unused days of the then-current Subscription Term. If you have
                        any problems or concerns with your cancellation please contact us at support@LxRoot.com for
                        assistance.

                        (a) If you purchase any Services that we offer for a fee, either on a one-time or on a
                        Subscription basis (collectively “Fees”), you agree and consent to LxRoot’s use of third-party
                        payment providers for billing and processing online payments (see below), and you agree to pay
                        the applicable Fees for the Services (including, without limitation, periodic fees for
                        Subscriptions) as they become due, plus all related taxes, and to reimburse us for all
                        collection costs and interest for any overdue amounts. Unless separately negotiated by You and
                        Us, and confirmed by separate written agreement, the initial and recurring Fees for the Services
                        selected by You shall be as provided in the initial on-line order form. All set-up fees and
                        special programming fees are non-refundable. Unless otherwise indicated, we may invoice Fees for
                        Services in advance. Failure to make payment of Fees for Services when due may result in the
                        suspension or termination of Services.

                        (b) Services are billed on an automatic, auto-renewal and recurring basis unless and until you
                        follow LxRoot's cancellation procedure set forth in this Agreement. Your obligation to pay fees
                        continues through the end of the Subscription Term (defined in Section 6(c)). Our Subscriptions
                        may be subject to usage limits. You agree and understand that we verify use of the Service
                        periodically. If as part of a routine verification process, we determine that Usage exceeds the
                        current amount of usage limits purchased, we reserve the right to invoice you for the additional
                        use. We may contact you to discuss your current plan and other options available to you. You
                        agree to upgrade to a higher usage plan if necessary.

                        (c) At the time of registration, you must select a payment method. By providing a payment
                        method, you expressly authorize LxRoot to charge said payment method at regular intervals
                        subject to Your Particular Subscription. LxRoot reserves the right to contract with a third
                        party to process all payments. Such third party may impose additional terms and conditions
                        governing payment processing. If You do not pay all Fees when due, your account will be deemed
                        past due. For any past due Fees, LxRoot reserves the right to charge You interest at five
                        percent (5%) or the highest rate allowed by applicable law, whichever is lower, per month of the
                        unpaid amount, until paid.

                        (d) You agree to pay any and all taxes, including personal property, value added, or sales
                        taxes, resulting from Your use of the Services. LxRoot is not responsible for any bank fees
                        incurred by You due to Your use of check cards, automatic payment services, insufficient funds,
                        and any and all other fees your financial institution may impose due to Your use of the
                        Services. If LxRoot should receive less than full payment of the Fees due to taxes, bank
                        charges, transfer fees, or the like, LxRoot will invoice You for the difference between payment
                        received and the Fees due. You also agree to pay all attorney and collection fees arising from
                        LxRoot's efforts to collect any past-due Fees.

                        (e) If you cancel any Service prior to the expiration of the pre-paid Fees, you understand and
                        agree that LxRoot, at its sole discretion, may not issue You any refund whatsoever, including
                        but not limited to any remaining pre-paid Fees, set up Fees, and/or special programming Fees.
                        Any refunds, if any, will be refunded to the original method of payment only.

                        (f) If you do not pay on time or if LxRoot cannot charge your payment method for any reason,
                        LxRoot reserves the right to either suspend or terminate your Subscription, access to the
                        Services, and/or Account and terminate these Terms.

                        (g) Coupons and Discount Codes. From time to time, LxRoot may offer coupons or other discount
                        codes which may be used when signing up for Services with Us. Coupons and discount codes are for
                        first-time customers of LxRoot only and must be used at the time of Your initial purchase with
                        Us – they may not be applied after commencement of the Services. Unless expressly provided, such
                        coupons and discount codes may not be used toward upgrades to Your account. Any account We deem
                        to be attempting unauthorized coupon or discount code use may be subject to Termination for
                        Cause (see Section 9).

                        (a) LxRoot may terminate your Subscription in its sole discretion at any time for any reason or
                        no reason ("Termination without Cause"). In such case, LxRoot will provide You with thirty (30)
                        days written notice before the discontinuation of Services. If LxRoot cancels your Subscription
                        pursuant to any of the terms outlined in these Terms, with the exception of Termination without
                        Cause, LxRoot shall not refund to You any fees paid or prepaid in advance of such cancellation
                        and You shall be obligated to pay all fees and charges accrued prior to the effectiveness of
                        such cancellation. In the event that LxRoot terminates the Agreement for cause, all prepaid Fees
                        will be forfeited and are not refundable. The termination of your Subscription does not relieve
                        You of Your obligation to pay any Fees accrued or payable to LxRoot prior to the effective date
                        of termination of your Subscription.

                        (b) In addition to LxRoot's right to terminate your Subscription provided elsewhere in these
                        Terms, LxRoot may terminate your Subscription effective immediately if, based on LxRoot's sole
                        judgment, it determines that You or any of Your end users: (i) have breached the Acceptable Use
                        Policy ("AUP") or Anti-Spam Policy, (ii) have infringed or violated any intellectual property
                        right or privacy or publicity right of a third party, (iii) have not complied with any
                        applicable law, statute or regulation, or (iv) have uploaded, published or disseminated any
                        images, text, graphics, code or video which LxRoot considers illegal or high risk, in its
                        discretion, or (v) breached these Terms. Nothing contained in these Terms is intended to, or
                        shall, impose any duty or obligation upon LxRoot to monitor or review Your Content (defined in
                        Section 12) or the content of Your end users at any time. You remain solely responsible for Your
                        Content, and any liability generated therefrom.

                        (c) The termination of your Subscription will end Your access to the Services and Your license
                        to the Materials. LxRoot shall not be liable to You or to any third party for termination of the
                        Services permitted under these Terms. Upon termination of your Subscription, LxRoot reserves the
                        right to maintain copies of Your data flees and records for archival purposes but does not
                        undertake any obligation to do so. LxRoot reserves the right to impose an early termination
                        charge for all Services terminated prior to the last day of the billing cycle.

                        (d) If either party cancels or terminates your Subscription for any reason, you shall be solely
                        responsible for making all necessary arrangements for securing a replacement service provider
                        and timely moving all electronic data, graphics, images, video or text to the new service
                        provider.

                        (e) LxRoot will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any suspension or termination,
                        including for deletion of Content. All provisions of the Terms, which by their nature should
                        survive, shall survive termination of the Service, including without limitation, ownership
                        provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitation of liability. You may close your Account by
                        using the feature provided in the Services or, in the alternative, by emailing us at

                        11.1 Content.

                        (a) You are responsible for the information, text, opinions, messages, comments, audio visual
                        works, motion pictures, photographs, animation, videos, graphics, sounds, music, software, Apps,
                        and any other content or material that You or your end users submit, upload, post, host, store,
                        or otherwise make available (“Make Available”) on or through the Services (collectively, “Your
                        Content,” “Content” or “User Content”). You may not Make Available on the Services any material
                        protected by copyright, trademark, or any other proprietary right without the express permission
                        of the owner of such copyright, trademark or other proprietary right owned by a third party, and
                        the burden of determining whether any such right protects any material is on you. You shall be
                        solely liable for any damage resulting from any infringement of copyrights, trademarks,
                        proprietary rights, violation of contract, privacy or publicity rights or any other harm
                        resulting from any User Content that you make or submit. As between you and us, you own your
                        User Content and you have full responsibility for all User Content you make or submit, including
                        its legality, reliability and appropriateness, while using the Services. You hereby grant to
                        LxRoot a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide license
                        (including the right to sublicense through multiple tiers) to use, reproduce, process, adapt,
                        publicly perform, publicly display, modify, prepare derivative works, publish, transmit and
                        distribute each of your User Content, or any portion thereof, in any form, medium or
                        distribution method now known or hereafter existing, known or developed, and otherwise use and
                        commercialize the User Content in any way that LxRoot deems appropriate, without any further
                        consent, notice and/or compensation to you or to any third parties, for purposes of providing
                        the Services to you.

                        (b) LxRoot will not actively monitor Content being hosted by LxRoot, although LxRoot, at its
                        sole discretion, may elect to electronically monitor its network and may disclose any content or
                        records concerning Your Account as necessary to satisfy any law, regulation, or other
                        governmental request or to properly operate Our network and protect any of Our customers. LxRoot
                        will investigate complaints of a violation of a third-party right or of the AUP. LxRoot will
                        cooperate with those attempting to minimize Internet abuse and reserves the right to institute
                        "filters" or other mechanisms for that purpose. LxRoot will cooperate with law enforcement
                        authorities and reserves the right to notify such authorities if it suspects that You or any of
                        Your end users are engaged in illegal activities. Nothing contained in this Section, or anywhere
                        in these Terms, is intended to bestow any rights on any third party, and no third parties shall
                        be entitled to enforce any terms of these Terms between us, the parties.

                        (c) You acknowledge and expressly agree that LxRoot will not be liable to You or any of Your end
                        users for any action LxRoot takes to remove or restrict access to the Services for any alleged
                        violation of the AUP, or exercising its rights as a Good Samaritan under the Telecommunications
                        Act of 1996 (47 U.S.C. § 230(d)) or under the DMCA.

                        LxRoot may, at its sole discretion, immediately terminate Your Account and access to the
                        Services, and terminate these Terms for cause, if Your conduct violates our Policies (See
                        Section 10), or if any of Your end users' or downstream customers' conduct violate such
                        Policies. We respect the intellectual property rights of all parties and have adopted a policy
                        regarding termination of repeat copyright infringers under the DMCA (See Section 11).

                        (e) Child Pornography. LxRoot takes the issue of child pornography very seriously, and any
                        potential harm to minors using our Services is strictly prohibited. Content that is or may be
                        perceived to be child pornography will be immediately removed from public access upon
                        notification or detection by Us. Additionally, LxRoot reserves the right to terminate any
                        Account whose website(s) hosts or links to child pornography immediately and without notice to
                        You. If the account is a LxRoot reseller account, the account will be suspended, and the
                        reseller will be directed to terminate the responsible account. You agree to cooperate in any
                        such efforts. Content or communications seeking to solicit, lure or entice minors into sexual
                        activity or lewd behavior is also strictly prohibited, and will be treated the same as, or
                        similar to, child pornography, consistent with applicable law. You agree to cooperate with
                        LxRoot in any effort to investigate, disable or remove such Content originating with Your end
                        users. Consistent with federal law, LxRoot will cooperate with law enforcement authorities and
                        will notify such authorities if it suspects that You or any of Your downstream customers or end
                        users are engaged in any such illegal activities.

                        In accordance with the reporting requirements of 18 U.S.C.
                        § 2258A, We will report to the CyberTipline (report.cybertip.org) any actual knowledge of
                        apparent violations of 18 U.S.C §§ 2251, 2251A, 2252, 2252A, 2252B, 2260, or 1466A. If You
                        suspect any instances of child pornography appearing on sites hosted by LxRoot, We encourage You
                        to send such reports to Our abuse address at abuse@LxRoot.com, and include the flee name and/or
                        URL (or other location on the Customer's site), victim (if known), date of birth, date of
                        production, and any other information about the suspect image(s). Do not send the image(s) in
                        question. Alternately, you may use the CyberTipline to report suspected child pornography.
                        Reports involving sites not hosted by LxRoot should be directed to law enforcement or to a
                        cooperating child pornography organization such as:
                        https://www.asacp.org/index.php?content=report.

                        (f) Content appropriate for Minors and Section 230 Notice: You acknowledge Your responsibility
                        to prevent minors under Your care from accessing harmful or inappropriate material on Your site
                        and services. You agree not to allow minors to view any such materials and agree to take
                        responsible measures to prevent them from doing so. Numerous commercial online safety filters
                        are available which may help users limit minors' access to harmful or inappropriate material.
                        Pursuant to 47 U.S.C. §230(d), you are hereby informed that you can research such services at
                        websites such as www.asacp.org. Please note that the Service makes no representation or warranty
                        regarding any of the products or services referenced on such sites and recommends that the user
                        conduct appropriate due diligence before purchasing or installing any online filter. You agree
                        to take particular steps to prevent minors from viewing these kind of materials if Your computer
                        can be accessed by a minor. Finally, you agree that if You are a parent or guardian of a minor
                        child, it is Your responsibility, not Ours, to keep any age-restricted content on Our Site from
                        being displayed or accessed by Your children or wards.

                        Pursuant to the Communications Decency Act ("CDA"), 47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(1), and court decisions
                        interpreting the scope of the CDA, you acknowledge and understand that LxRoot operates as the
                        provider of an interactive computer service. Thus, we are immune from, and cannot be held
                        responsible for, claims arising from the publication of Your Content (including third-party
                        content published on Your web site(s)). We do not create such content, and We are not
                        responsible for the publication of remarks or communications of You or third-parties that may
                        arguably rise to the level of being actionable under federal or state laws including, but not
                        limited to, the publication of material that might be considered defamatory, or violate of
                        privacy or publicity rights. Note, that federal law allows LxRoot to remove any content found to
                        be offensive, defamatory, obscene or otherwise violate of Our policies, without impacting Our
                        immunity status as an interactive computer service. Nothing contained in this Section is
                        intended to limit or alter the immunity from claims provided by Section 230 of the
                        Communications Decency Act. In the event that any court finds that any third-party communication
                        or third-party content hosted by us falls outside of the realm of the immunity provided by the
                        CDA, this shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any legal protections provided by Section 230
                        for any and all other content posted on our Site or hosted via our Services.

                        11.2 Specific Requirements for Service Providers and User-Generated Content Subscribers.

                        (a) If You use Our Services for any site, sub-domain, page or business model that allows Your
                        end users or customers to control or upload material to Internet space assigned to You by Us,
                        you shall be deemed to be acting as a "Service Provider" with respect to such services and/or
                        customers. Service Providers include but are not limited to customers which; (i) resell
                        bandwidth as hosts to third parties; (ii) operate user-generated content sites such as forums,
                        "tube" sites, review sites, and online classified advertising sites; (iii) operate search
                        engines; or

                        (iv) operate peer-to-peer flee sharing networks. Customers acting as a Service Provider for
                        third-party users shall comply with the following provisions:

                        You shall notify Us of all domains, web pages or IP addresses for which You are acting as a
                        Service Provider.

                        You shall comply with 17 U.S.C. §512 of the DMCA by properly designating an agent for receipt of
                        copyright infringement notices, and You shall publish a link on the home page of any website for
                        which You are a Service Provider to a DMCA Notice and Takedown Policy, identifying the website's
                        designated agent and associated contact information. "Service Providers" within the meaning of
                        17 U.S.C. § 512(k)(1) require that any DMCA Notices relating to alleged infringement of a LxRoot
                        Service Provider Customer be submitted directly to the DMCA Agent designated by such Customer.

                        You shall provide Us with a current link to Your DMCA Notice and Takedown Policy and further
                        advise Us of any changes to Your Designated Agent contact information. This shall be a
                        continuing obligation for as long as You use Our Services.

                        It is the policy of LxRoot to provide any infringement notices it receives relating to Service
                        Provider subscribers directly to the subscriber's Designated DMCA Agent, and to further notify
                        any copyright claimants of the identity and contact information for such Agent. Failure to
                        maintain compliance with this section shall constitute a material breach of these Terms.

                        (b) In keeping with Our DMCA policies and obligations set forth above, You understand, agree,
                        and expressly allow Us to access and subsequently disable public access to any flees or data
                        residing on the server, disk, partition, or other data space under Your control when such flees
                        or data, in Our discretion: (i) have been identified in a substantially- compliant DMCA notice
                        under 17 U.S.C. § 512; or (ii) when We become aware of facts or circumstances indicating that
                        such flees or data are infringing on the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of
                        third parties. Given that Our customers may employ various methods of securing flees in
                        conjunction with Our Services, and in an attempt to avoid material disruption of Our Customers’
                        Services, you agree that You will provide Us with Your preferred procedure for disabling access
                        to material identified under this provision. If We forward You a substantially-compliant DMCA
                        Notice and which concerns content under Your control, you are obligated under these Terms to
                        immediately disable or remove access to such content. Irrespective of the above, we reserve the
                        right to disable or remove access to such content, in Our discretion, and without claim of
                        damage or injury by You. While We will attempt to simply disable access to such Content without
                        fully deleting it, or suspending all services to your Account, we make no warranties concerning
                        harm or injury to the Content, and reserve the right to take any necessary actions to disable
                        access to the identified material, including suspension or termination of Services. It is
                        therefore in Your best interest to promptly respond to any DMCA Notices You may receive. Should
                        You or Your web site's users feel that such DMCA Notice was erroneously or improperly sent, You
                        must follow the Counter- Notification procedure set forth in our Copyright Policy, and wait the
                        required period of time, before We allow public access to the content to resume.

                        (c) Nothing contained in this Section, or any part of these Terms, shall constitute legal or
                        professional advice regarding any matter referenced therein. You are responsible for obtaining
                        your own legal advice regarding compliance with any and all applicable laws or regulations.

                        11.3 Content that you Make Publicly Available.

                        (a) In addition to the license granted in Section 11.1(a), You also authorize others to use the

                        software and/or services (collectively, “Third-Party Services”, offered by one or more “Third
                        Party”) in connection with the LxRoot Services such as through the LxRoot Marketplace (see
                        Section 14), and LxRoot may in its sole discretion help facilitate Your use of such Third-Party
                        Services in connection with the LxRoot Services, however You acknowledge and agree as follows:

                        (i) You are solely responsible for purchasing or licensing Third- Party Services as may be
                        required by any such third party;
                        (ii) You shall be subject to any applicable terms governing such Third-Party Services, which are
                        in addition to this Agreement;
                        (iii) You shall pay all fees charged by such third party for such Third-Party Services, and
                        recognize that the terms governing such fees (including any price adjustments) are not
                        necessarily in LxRoot’s control, even if payment is facilitated through the LxRoot Services;
                        (iv) regardless of LxRoot’s assistance, You are solely responsible for installing and
                        maintaining any Third-Party Services at Your expense; and
                        (v) LXROOT SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR ANY THIRD-PARTY SERVICES, and any assistance
                        provided by LxRoot in connection with such Third-Party Services shall not alter Your
                        responsibility or Our liability disclaimer under this section.

                        You agree and understand that you, and not LxRoot, are solely responsible for your compliance
                        with the licensing terms of any Third-Party Services or products that are made available to you
                        within the LxRoot Services. If LxRoot notifies you of any reporting or compliance obligations to
                        the Third-Party provider, it is your obligation to report your own usage and comply with any
                        licensing terms. LxRoot will not and does not monitor your compliance.

                        Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such Third-Party provider finds you (or any of LxRoot’s
                        customers) non- compliant with the Third Party’s agreement or obligations, LxRoot reserves the
                        right to terminate the Services or Account of the non-compliant customer, without giving any
                        advance notice. You agree and understand that LxRoot may and will share all available Customer
                        data with the applicable Third Party if contractually obligated.

                        (b) Third-Party Sites and Links. The Services may also be linked to other websites that are not
                        LxRoot properties (collectively, “Third-Party Sites”). You acknowledge and agree that the
                        Third-Party Sites may have different privacy policies and terms and conditions and/or user
                        guides and business practices than LxRoot, and you further acknowledge and agree that your use
                        of such Third-Party Sites is governed by the respective Third-Party Site privacy policy and
                        terms and conditions and/or user guides. You hereby agree to comply with any and all terms and
                        conditions, users guide and privacy policies of any of Third-Party Sites. LxRoot does not
                        verify, make any representations or take responsibility for any Third-Party Site, including,
                        without limitation, the truthfulness, accuracy, quality or completeness of the content,
                        services, links displayed and/or any other activities conducted on or through such Third-Party
                        Sites. YOU AGREE THAT LXROOT WILL NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE,
                        DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR ANY GOODS, SERVICES, INFORMATION, RESOURCES AND/OR CONTENT AVAILABLE
                        ON OR THROUGH ANY THIRD-PARTY SITES AND/OR THIRD-PARTY DEALINGS OR COMMUNICATIONS, OR FOR ANY
                        HARM RELATED THERETO, OR FOR ANY DAMAGES OR LOSS CAUSED OR ALLEGED TO BE CAUSED BY OR IN
                        CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OR RELIANCE ON THE CONTENT OR BUSINESS PRACTICES OF ANY THIRD PARTY.
                        Any reference on the Services to any product, service, publication, institution, organization of
                        any third-party entity or individual does not constitute or imply LxRoot's endorsement or
                        recommendation.

                        (c) Bring Your Own License. Bring Your Own License (“BYOL”) is the process by which you bring
                        your previously purchased licenses to run on our cloud (“LxRoot Cloud”). Our deployment model
                        has options to meet platform licensing needs, i.e. you can use licenses provided by us or you
                        can bring your own. When you BYOL, any licensing costs of the product you bring is removed from
                        the price of the instance, and you are solely responsible for managing your licenses.
